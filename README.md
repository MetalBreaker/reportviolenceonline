# Report violence online
Currently a heavy work in progress. Not even the main functionality is done, sadly.
The 3 main goals are for the site to be:
- Secure
- Anonymous
- Fast

Current modern cryptography methods would allow the reported cases of violence to remain safe and anonymous even after a database breach, or if someone with physical access tried to dump the website's database.
